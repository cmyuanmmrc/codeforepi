In the progams, we mark the relevant output in the corresponding sections with comments. Readers can find the corresponding results in program with the procecdure in our paper.
The procedure to test our results is as follows:

First run Maple programs to obtain constraints with different types, and the representation of the E_l(m,n). 
Then, rewrite the problem as a SOS problem with matrix representation and a set of parameters.
Turn to the Matlab pakage CVX to solve the SOS problem and output the value of parameters.
Finally, use Maple program to verify the SOS representation.
